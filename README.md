Cataract diagnosis project notebook using VGG16


Cataracts are a common eye condition that primarily affects older individuals, although they can occur in people of all ages. The term "cataract" refers to the clouding of the eye's natural lens, which is typically clear and transparent. This clouding occurs as a result of the clumping together of proteins within the lens, leading to a gradual loss of transparency.

The lens of the eye plays a crucial role in focusing light onto the retina, allowing us to see clearly. When cataracts develop, the clouded lens scatters and distorts light, causing vision problems. Individuals with cataracts often experience symptoms such as blurred or hazy vision, increased sensitivity to glare, difficulty seeing in low light conditions, and a noticeable reduction in the vibrancy of colors.

Imaging of the retina for the diagnosis of cataracts is referred to as "cataractography" or "cataractology." This process involves using various imaging techniques such as anterior segment imaging or posterior segment imaging.

One common technique in this field involves passing light through the retina using a specific lens designed to reveal details placed within the lens. These images are then examined by ophthalmologists to detect indicators of cataracts or any other changes in the retina or eye elements.

Through cataractography, eye care professionals can observe changes in the eye lens and assess the degree of opacity and the impact on visual quality. This information aids doctors in making appropriate treatment decisions for managing cataracts, including the consideration of surgical intervention if necessary.

In this project, using retinal images, we divide them into two classes: normal and cataract.
